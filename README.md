A repo containing some studies on algorithms and data structures in many
different programming languages.

## Data Structures

List of data structures in this repo:

##### Linked List

> A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given
> by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the
> next. It is a data structure consisting of nodes which together represent a
> sequence.

Linked lists are among the simplest and most common data structures. They can be
used to implement several other common [abstract data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type)
including: lists, stacks, queues, associatives arrays and S-expressions.

## Doubly Linked List

> A doubly linked list is a linked data structure that consists of a set of
> sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains three fields:
> two link fields (references to the previous and to the next node in the
> sequence of nodes) and one data field. The beginning and ending nodes'
> previous and next links, respectively, point to some kind of terminator,
> typically a sentinel node or null, to facilitate traversal of the list.

#### Queue

> A queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can
> be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the
> removal of entities from the other end of the sequence.

#### Stack

> A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements with
> two main operations: Push, which adds an element to the collection, and Pop,
> which removes the most recently added element. (...) The order in which an
> element added to or removed from a stack is described as last in, first out,
> referred to by the acronym LIFO.

![Lifo stack](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Lifo_stack.svg)

Stacks are normally used to implement
[Backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) algorithms, most of
the memory management in programming languages, specifically on functions (call
stack) and some compilers to make syntax parser.
