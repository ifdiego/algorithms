# Linked List

> A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given

Linked lists are among the simplest and most common data structures. They can be
used to implement several other common [abstract data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type)
including: lists, stacks, queues, associatives arrays and S-expressions.

## Doubly Linked List

> A doubly linked list is a linked data structure that consists of a set of
> sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains three fields:
> two link fields (references to the previous and to the next node in the
> sequence of nodes) and one data field. The beginning and ending nodes'
> previous and next links, respectively, point to some kind of terminator,
> typically a sentinel node or null, to facilitate traversal of the list.
