# fun

Experiments with tools, programming languages, databases, UNIX scripts and
everything related to programming in general which is small enough to have your
own repository.

This is my own version of [@leandronsp/fun](https://github.com/leandronsp/fun)
and [@lucasew/playground](https://github.com/lucasew/playground).
